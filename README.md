- At least 10GB free disk space
- ffmpeg (for audio processing)

### Installation Steps

1. **Install ffmpeg**:
   ```bash
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd voice-ai-agent-start
   ```

3. **Set up Chatterbox TTS**:
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv venv-py311
   source venv-py311/bin/activate
   pip install chatterbox-tts torchaudio
   ```

4. **Set up Bark TTS**:
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv venv-bark
   source venv-bark/bin/activate
   pip install torch==2.5.1 torchaudio==2.5.1
   pip install git+https://github.com/suno-ai/bark.git scipy
   ```

5. **Set up XTTS-v2**:
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv venv-xtts-new
   source venv-xtts-new/bin/activate
   pip install TTS
   ```
